## 🤔 Why

You buy a great technical book. You read it once. Three months later you can't remember chapter 7 existed.

The usual workarounds don't help:
- 📄 "Let me just search the PDF" → you get a list of pages, not answers
- 🧠 "I'll ask Claude about this book" → it either hallucinates or says it doesn't have the content
- 📝 "I'll take notes as I read" → you end up with a 200-line doc you never open again

**book-to-skill solves this by turning the PDF into a structured skill Claude loads on demand.**

Once installed, you just type `/your-book-slug replication` and Claude reads the right chapter and answers from the actual content. No hallucination. No digging through PDFs. The book becomes part of your workflow.

## 📦 What it generates

Running `/book-to-skill your-book.pdf` creates a full skill at `~/.claude/skills/<slug>/`:

| File | Purpose | Size |
|------|---------|------|
| `SKILL.md` | Core mental models + chapter index | ~4,000 tokens |
| `chapters/ch01-*.md` … | One file per chapter, loaded on-demand | ~1,000 tokens each |
| `glossary.md` | Every key term, alphabetically sorted with chapter refs | ~1,500 tokens |
| `patterns.md` | All techniques, algorithms, and design patterns | ~2,000 tokens |
| `cheatsheet.md` | Decision tables and quick-reference rules | ~1,000 tokens |

**Chapter files are loaded on-demand** — they don't count against the skill budget until you ask about that topic.

## 🚀 Usage

```
/book-to-skill <path-to-pdf> [skill-name-slug]
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Derive skill name from filename
/book-to-skill ~/Downloads/designing-data-intensive-applications.pdf

# Specify a custom slug
/book-to-skill ~/books/clean-code.pdf clean-code

# Full path with explicit name
/book-to-skill /tmp/ddd-evans.pdf domain-driven-design
```

After the skill is created, use it like any other Claude Code skill:

```bash
/designing-data-intensive-apps                  # load core mental models
/designing-data-intensive-apps replication      # find and explain a topic
/designing-data-intensive-apps ch05             # dive into chapter 5
/designing-data-intensive-apps "what chapters do you have?"
```

## 🔧 Requirements

At least one PDF extraction tool must be installed:

| Tool | Install | Quality |
|------|---------|---------|
| `pdftotext` (poppler) | `sudo apt install poppler-utils` | ⭐⭐⭐ Best layout fidelity |
| `PyPDF2` | `pip3 install PyPDF2` | ⭐⭐ Good |
| `pdfminer.six` | `pip3 install pdfminer.six` | ⭐⭐ Good fallback |

The extraction script tries them in order and uses the first available. If none is found, it tells you exactly which command to run.

     Generates glossary, patterns, cheatsheet
     Generates master SKILL.md with core mental models

<details>
<summary>Design principles (click to expand)</summary>

1. **Density over completeness** — a 1,000-token summary beats a 10,000-token excerpt
2. **Practitioner voice** — "Use X when Y", not "The book explains X"
3. **Front-loaded SKILL.md** — compaction keeps the first ~5,000 tokens; the most important content comes first
4. **On-demand chapters** — the topic index tells Claude which file to read; chapters load only when needed
5. **Never raw text** — always synthesize, summarize, extract signal from the source

```

Or manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/book-to-skill/scripts

curl -o ~/.claude/skills/book-to-skill/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/virgiliojr94/book-to-skill/master/SKILL.md

curl -o ~/.claude/skills/book-to-skill/scripts/extract.py \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/virgiliojr94/book-to-skill/master/scripts/extract.py
```

Then in any Claude Code session:

```bash
/book-to-skill ~/path/to/your-book.pdf
```
